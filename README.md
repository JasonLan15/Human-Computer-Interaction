# Human-Computer-Interaction

**Project Overview** <br>
This project explores Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) concepts and applies them to the design and development of user‑centred interfaces. The repository includes website code and design assets created as part of a research‑driven workflow focused on understanding user needs and translating HCI theory into practical interface solutions.
<br>

**What This Project Demonstrates**
- Research and application of HCI principles
- Development of interfaces using user‑centred design
- Use of user stories to define requirements and guide design decisions
- Greyscale‑first UI design to prioritise structure, hierarchy, and usability
- Minimal, clean code practices for clarity and maintainability
<br>

**Purpose** <br>
To investigate HCI methods and demonstrate how research‑led insights can inform the creation of intuitive, accessible, and well‑structured digital interfaces.
